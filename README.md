# Guidelines
1) Prevent overblocking by applying the law of [diminishing returns](https://pmctraining.com/site/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Law-of-Diminishing-Returns-CHART.png) (by using [sane](https://privacyguides.org/basics/threat-modeling), quality blocklists).
2) Aim for [efficiency](https://brave.com/the-mounting-cost-of-stale-ad-blocking-rules/) without sacrificing quality (avoid redundancy and bloat when possible).
3) Implement the [minimum number](https://old.reddit.com/r/uBlockOrigin/wiki/index#wiki_which_filter_lists_should_i_select.3F) of needed and useful lists.

## Privacy

1) :star: **Privacy Essentials** (1k rules) | [add](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yokoffing/filterlists/main/privacy_essentials.txt) 
<br> A curated list for advanced hardening. Includes my [click2load](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yokoffing/filterlists/main/click2load.txt) filterlist<sup>*[^what is this?](https://unofficialbird.com/gorhill/status/1377613392559636486)*</sup> and blocks requests like `connect.facebook.com` and more that are not covered by uBO's [default settings](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/wiki/uBlock-and-others:-Blocking-ads,-trackers,-malwares#observations). **Note:** This list breaks third-party logins.

### URL Tracking Parameters

Add the functionality of [ClearURLs](https://github.com/ClearURLs/Addon#-clearurls-) to uBO. If you find websites with tracking parameters or experience breakage, you can submit those [here](https://github.com/DandelionSprout/adfilt/discussions/163?sort=new).

1) :star: **[Actually Legitimate URL Shortener Tool](https://github.com/DandelionSprout/adfilt/discussions/163?sort=new)** (2k rules) | [add](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DandelionSprout/adfilt/master/LegitimateURLShortener.txt)
<br> This list also [includes](https://github.com/DandelionSprout/adfilt/discussions/163?sort=old#discussioncomment-3956776) all entries from `AdGuard's URL Tracking Protection` as of October 2022.

2) **[ClearURLs for uBO](https://github.com/DandelionSprout/adfilt/tree/master/ClearURLs%20for%20uBo)** (700 rules) | [add](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DandelionSprout/adfilt/master/ClearURLs%20for%20uBo/clear_urls_uboified.txt)
<br> (**optional:** This list may break websites and may contain problematic rules. There is not much the maintainers can do, as this list is just the ClearURLs rules converted into a filterlist.)

### Fonts

1) **Block third-party fonts** (70 rules) | [add](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yokoffing/filterlists/main/block_third_party_fonts.txt)
<br> (**optional:** This will break the "look and feel" of some sites.)
<br> A successor to [Fanboy's Anti-thirdparty Fonts](https://github.com/ryanbr/fanboy-adblock/blob/master/fanboy-antifonts.txt), this option blocks all web fonts from third-party providers but allows the browser to download fonts from first-party domains. I prefer this method because it avoids third-party domains (speed and privacy benefit), and I trust the first-party site to download a font from them.<sup>[1](https://collinmbarrett.com/block-web-fonts/)</sup>
 
## Annoyances

1) :star: **yokoffing's Annoyance List** (1k rules) | [add](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yokoffing/filterlists/main/annoyance_list.txt)
<br> A curated list that captures nuisances missed by other maintainers. It also cleans up the clutter around many sites (e.g., related articles, "read more', etc.).

2) **[Browse websites without logging in](https://github.com/DandelionSprout/adfilt/blob/master/BrowseWebsitesWithoutLoggingIn.txt)** (370 rules) | [add](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DandelionSprout/adfilt/master/BrowseWebsitesWithoutLoggingIn.txt)
<br> This list attempts to bypass forced logins on sites.

### Paywalls
:warning: To bypass paywalls effectively, you should use the **Bypass Paywalls Clean** extenstion for [Chrome](https://gitlab.com/magnolia1234/bypass-paywalls-chrome-clean) or [Firefox](https://gitlab.com/magnolia1234/bypass-paywalls-firefox-clean). These lists are [limited](https://gitlab.com/magnolia1234/bypass-paywalls-clean-filters#bypass-paywalls-clean-filters) in what they can do and are therefore **optional**:

1) **[Bypass Paywalls Clean filter](https://gitlab.com/magnolia1234/bypass-paywalls-clean-filters)** (960 rules) | [add](https://gitlab.com/magnolia1234/bypass-paywalls-clean-filters/-/raw/main/bpc-paywall-filter.txt)
<br> The Bypass Paywalls Clean (BPC) filter is from the same [developer](https://gitlab.com/magnolia1234) as the [add-on](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/bypass-paywalls-clean/) implementation. You do not need this filterlist if you use the extension.
 
2) **[Anti-paywall filters](https://github.com/liamengland1/miscfilters/blob/master/antipaywall.txt)** (2k rules) | [add](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/liamengland1/miscfilters/master/antipaywall.txt)
 <br> This list blocks additional third-party requests and annoyances that are not covered in the `Bypass Paywalls Clean` filterlist.

## Security

1) :star: [**Most Abused TLDs**](https://github.com/hagezi/dns-blocklists#most-abused-tlds---protects-against-known-malicious-top-level-domains-) (206 rules) | [add](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hagezi/dns-blocklists/main/adblock/spam-tlds-ublock.txt)
<br> Displays a warning before navigating to a site with an abused [TLD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Top-level_domain). Allows exceptions for legitimate sites. Merged from my own [Enhanced website protection](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yokoffing/filterlists/main/enhanced_site_protection.txt) list, Dandelion Sprout's `Anti-Malware List`, LennyFox's `Block non-Latin TLDs` [list](https://github.com/LennyFox/Blocklists/blob/master/Block_non_latin_TLDs.txt), and [Spamhaus](https://www.spamhaus.org/statistics/tlds/) statistics.

2) **[Dandelion Sprout's Anti-Malware List](https://github.com/DandelionSprout/adfilt/blob/master/Dandelion%20Sprout's%20Anti-Malware%20List.txt)** (42k rules) | [add](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DandelionSprout/adfilt/master/Dandelion%20Sprout's%20Anti-Malware%20List.txt)
<br> This list blocks domains with high abuse rates and their search results. It also blocks domains involved in malware redirects, domain parking, and Windows PUP ads. It has many other subcategories that distinguish it from similar lists.

3) **[The malicious website blocklist](https://github.com/iam-py-test/my_filters_001#filters-in-this-repo)** (38k rules) | [add](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iam-py-test/my_filters_001/main/antimalware.txt)
<br> This version includes author comments, [vxvault.net's list](https://github.com/iam-py-test/vxvault_filter), the [anti-PUP list](https://github.com/iam-py-test/my_filters_001/blob/main/antipup.txt), and [additional rules](https://github.com/iam-py-test/my_filters_001/blob/main/special_lists/anti-malware-ubo-extension.txt) for uBO.

## All-Purpose

1) [**Hagezi's Personal DNS Blocklist**](https://github.com/hagezi/dns-blocklists#personal---my-manually-maintained-denylist-) (41k domains) | [add](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hagezi/dns-blocklists/main/adblock/personal.txt)
<br> (**optional:** Unessential if you already use Hagezi's lists with a service like [NextDNS](https://nextdns.io/?from=xujj63g5) or [AdGuard DNS](https://github.com/hagezi/dns-blocklists#adguarddns---limited-freepaid-))
<br> Blocks ads, trackers, native device trackers, badware, and more. Hagezi maintains a sensible allowlist and handles false positives quickly. He also communicates known issues to community blocklists maintainers. Hagezi's primary DNS lists combine respected community blocklists like [OISD](https://oisd.nl/), [Steven Black](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/StevenBlack/hosts/master/hosts), [1Hosts](https://github.com/badmojr/1Hosts#safeguard-your-devices-against-pesky-ads-trackers-and-malware), [notrack](https://gitlab.com/quidsup/notrack#notrack), and [more](https://github.com/hagezi/dns-blocklists/blob/main/usedsources.md#proplus).

2) [**uBlock combo list**](https://github.com/iam-py-test/uBlock-combo) (81k rules) | [add](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iam-py-test/uBlock-combo/main/list.txt)
<br> (**optional:** You may not want all these sub-filters, or you may prefer to use the separate lists)
<br> This list filters URL tracking [parameters](https://github.com/DandelionSprout/adfilt/discussions/163?sort=new) as well as malware, scams, and phishing. It combines the following lists: [Dandelion Sprout's Anti-Malware List](https://github.com/yokoffing/filterlists#security), [Actually Legitimate URL Shortener Tool](https://github.com/yokoffing/filterlists#url-tracking-parameters), [The malicious website blocklist](https://github.com/yokoffing/filterlists#security), and the [anti-typo list](https://github.com/iam-py-test/my_filters_001/blob/main/antitypo.txt).

# Block Content with Fewer Rules

If you want to save CPU and memory resources on your device, you can use some alternative lists that have fewer filters than the built-in ones. uBO can handle more than 300k filters, but you might not need that many to block unwanted content effectively.

The lists below are designed to be lighter and faster but still maintain high standards for content blocking. The rule counts shown are when compared to their regular list in uBO.

## Ads

1) :star: **Easylist (Optimized)** (24k vs. 67k rules) | [add](https://filters.adtidy.org/extension/ublock/filters/101_optimized.txt)
<br> EasyList is the primary filter list that removes most adverts from web pages, including unwanted frames, images, and objects. It is the most popular list used by many ad blockers.

## Privacy

1) :stop_sign: **EasyPrivacy (Optimized)** (7k vs. 31k rules) | **use uBO's list instead!**
<br> EasyPrivacy is the primary filter list that completely removes all forms of tracking from the internet, including web bugs, tracking scripts, and information collectors, thereby protecting your personal data. [EasyPrivacy (Optimized)](https://filters.adtidy.org/extension/ublock/filters/118_optimized.txt) is excluded because I was not satisfied with the coverage. 

2) :star: [**Privacy Extended**](https://github.com/stephenhawk8054/PrivacyExtended) (17k vs. 47k rules) | [add](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/stephenhawk8054/PrivacyExtended/main/privacy_extended.txt)
<br> As a fork of [AdGuard Tracking Protection](https://filters.adtidy.org/extension/ublock/filters/3.txt), this list eliminates extra allowlisting caused by different [methods](https://github.com/easylist/easylist/issues/15018) between uBO and AdGuard, and resolves issues faster if the problems are [inconsistent](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/139081) between uBO and AdGuard. This list also removes redundant filters found in [EasyPrivacy](https://easylist.to/easylist/easyprivacy.txt).

## Annoyances

1) :star: **Fanboy Annoyances (Optimized)** (35k vs. 91k rules) | [add](https://filters.adtidy.org/extension/ublock/filters/122_optimized.txt)
<br> Hides website notifications, social media widgets, cookie notices, chat widgets, and some newsletters, thereby substantially decreasing web page loading times and uncluttering them. (Includes `EasyList - Cookie Notices` and `EasyList - Social Widgets`)

2) **EasyList - Social Widgets (Optimized)** (8k vs. 24k rules) | [add](https://filters.adtidy.org/extension/ublock/filters/123_optimized.txt)
<br> (**optional:** Already included in `Fanboy's Annoyances` list)
<br> Blocks social content, widgets, scripts, and icons.

3) **AdGuard Annoyances (Optimized)** (40k vs. 68k rules) | [add](https://filters.adtidy.org/extension/ublock/filters/14_optimized.txt)
<br> (**optional:** AdGuard claims that this list doesn't duplicate `Fanboy Annoyances`, so you can use them both together)
<br> Blocks irritating elements on webpages including cookie notices, third-party widgets, and in-page popups. Unlike Fanboy's version, this list doesn’t include social media widgets and buttons. To block them, you can use `AdGuard Social Media filter` separately.

4) **AdGuard Social Media filter (Optimized)** (14k vs. 20k rules) | [add](https://filters.adtidy.org/extension/ublock/filters/4_optimized.txt)
<br> (**optional:** Redundant with `Fanboy Annoyances` / `EasyList - Social Widgets`)
<br> If you do not like numerous `Like` and `Tweet` buttons on all the popular websites on the Internet, then subscribe to this filter and you will not see them anymore.

## FAQ

### Which browser works best with uBO?
[uBlock Origin](https://addons.mozilla.org/blog/ublock-origin-everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-ad-blocker/) works best in Mozilla Firefox. The features supported only on [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/) include preventing unwanted [DNS requests](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/wiki/Dashboard:-Settings#disable-prefetching) and CNAME [uncloaking](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/wiki/Dashboard:-Settings#uncloak-canonical-names).

### Should I use a content blocker if I have Pihole, NextDNS, ControlD, etc.?
uBlock Origin can [do more](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/wiki/About-%22Why-uBlock-Origin-works-so-much-better-than-Pi%E2%80%91hole-does%3F%22) compared to when only blocking requests at the DNS-level, like using [cosmetic filters](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/wiki/Does-uBlock-Origin-block-ads-or-just-hide-them%3F#cosmetic-filters) to hide first-party ads (e.g., [YouTube ads](https://discourse.pi-hole.net/t/how-do-i-block-ads-on-youtube/253)), [ad-placeholders](https://www.dslreports.com/forum/r33005057-How-to-block-the-spaces-taken-up-by-blocked-ads), web [annoyances]((https://old.reddit.com/r/nextdns/comments/t8qn8c/comment/hzqrrfa/?context=3)), etc.<sup>[1](https://help.nextdns.io/t/x2hzbps/using-nextdns-why-is-ublock-origin-still-catching-lots-of-ads)</sup>

### Why should I use these lists?
See [here](https://how-i-experience-web-today.com/).

### Why did you include AdGuard's Optimize lists but not AdBlock Plus' Minified lists?
The Minified lists are part of an Adblock Plus-hosted unofficial project that was hardforked from their source lists in August 2019. They are smaller than AdGuard's Optimized lists but lack quality blocking. Because EL and EP are your primary defenses with content blocking, I wouldn't use the Minified lists.
